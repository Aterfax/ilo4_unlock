# 2022-02-19: Building v2.77

Building v2.77 was pretty easy ... at this point, I've written offsets for v2.73, v2.79, and v2.78. I was pretty used to it.

I booted up and had the same issues with stdout -- the iLO hung if I called any of my fan commands. I stripped out the stdout function calls, and was very happy to see the `fan` commands WORKING! All that remains is to patch stdout.

## Stdout fixes
I wasn't surprised to see the stdout patch was breaking. It was the part of the code I looked at the least. I dug around for a while trying to find why the references would be messed up and break the stdout code. Ultimately, the solution was obvious and I documented it in patches/277/patches.md.

I didn't take very good notes here, so I don't have much to share. However, with the stdout bugs patched ...
